# RDF
This is some notes I make from the slides

## Knowledge representation

### Schema vs. Instance
Think of schema as a form and instance as a filled out form.
1. Schema (blueprint)
* defines the structure of the data
* classes, properties, shared vocab
* i.e. for a book (class), it hasTitle (property)

2. Instance
* actual data that conforms to the schema
* represent specific object
* i.e. a particular book (Harry Potter)

### SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
A standard vocabulary for organizing knowledge, specialised for thesauri, classification etc.
